        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>When we were asked to design a mobile app for a coffee company of our choosing, my first thought was to create an online ordering application for my friend’s historic tea company.</p>
        <p>Although Oliver Pluff &amp; Co. is quite literally steeped in history, I thought the company’s branding could use some updating. It was a ton of fun combining the old and the new on this UI assignment.</p>

          <p>In his bestselling book, The Tipping Point, Malcom Gladwell describes how the best way to make an idea, movement, or product “sticky,” is to make its message interactive in some way.</p>
          <p>I knew going into this project that transforming the buying process into a game might encourage users to return to the app more often to purchase Oliver Pluff &amp; Co. products.</p>

        <h2>Prototype</h2>
        <p>The final step in the process was to import the mockups I had created in Photoshop into InVision and to create hotspots that would lead the user through the mobile app. In doing all of this, I realized I was missing several screens that were necessary to experience the full user journey through the app. I went back and created several more “Haul” or checkout screens and keyboard screens in Photoshop for this reason.</p>
        <p>After successfully building a working prototype of the coffee app in InVision, I created an animated version in Principle, which is what you see to the left.</p>
